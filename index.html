    <p class="about_me_paragraph">Hello, my name is Andras Arato, and you may know me as the "Hide the Pain Harold" meme guy.
     I'm a retired electrical engineer from Hungary, and I never imagined that a simple photograph of me holding a trophy would turn me into an internet sensation.

    In 2008, that photograph was taken at an awards ceremony, and I had no idea it would go on to be one of the most popular memes on the internet.
    People started editing my face into all sorts of funny pictures, and before I knew it, I had become a viral sensation.
  
    But despite the strangeness of it all, I've come to embrace my internet fame.
    I've even attended meme-related events and have enjoyed meeting people who have been touched by my meme.
    It's been a surreal journey, but I'm grateful for the opportunities that have come my way because of it.
    Outside of my meme fame, I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, and traveling.
    I'm also an avid photographer and love taking pictures of the beautiful places I visit.
    Thanks for taking the time to read a little about me, and I hope you enjoy exploring more about my story.</p>

    <p class="about_me_paragraph">Oh, Cloud 9+ - Hide The Pain, what a song!
       It's no secret that I'm in the music video for this track, but my love for it goes beyond that.
       The upbeat melody and catchy lyrics just put me in such a good mood. I can't help but dance along every time I hear it.

      As someone who's experienced my fair share of internet fame and attention, the message of finding joy even in tough times really speaks to me.
      It's a reminder that no matter what life throws at us, we can always choose to focus on the positive and keep moving forward.
      
      Being a part of the music video was such a fun experience.
      Seeing all the different people come together to dance and celebrate was really special.
      And of course, I couldn't resist busting out a few of my own signature moves!</p>

    <h2>Q1</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Three main differences between web1, web2, and web3 are:</b>
      Web1 is a static web that provides basic information and has limited user interactivity.
      Web2 is a dynamic web that allows user interaction and collaboration, such as social networking and multimedia content creation.
      Web3 is a decentralized web that uses blockchain technology to create trustless systems and enable decentralized applications (dApps).
      Web1 and web2 rely on centralized servers and have a client-server architecture, where the server provides the content and the client consumes it.
      Web3, on the other hand, uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) network where every node can store and share data, enabling decentralized data storage and retrieval.
      Web1 and web2 rely on traditional web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      Web3, however, uses blockchain technologies like smart contracts, decentralized file storage, and decentralized identity management.

    <h2>Q2</h2>
    <p>
      Let's say the query search is "best restaurants in a certain city.
      " Here's how it might show up differently on web1 versus web3:
      On web1, the user might go to a static website that lists the top restaurants in a particular city based on reviews from food critics.
      The user can view the rankings and read brief descriptions of each restaurant, but cannot contribute their own reviews or ratings.
      On web3, the user might access a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to contribute and access information about restaurants in the city.
      The dApp might use a blockchain-based system to incentivize users to share their own reviews, ratings, and recommendations for restaurants.
      Users can interact with each other, leave comments, and share photos and videos of their meals.
      The information on the dApp is decentralized and more trustworthy since it's based on user-generated content and incentivized by blockchain rewards.
